## 1. Reconnaissance

### Checklist
- [ ] Enumerate AWS accounts and services.
- [ ] Identify active AWS regions.
- [ ] Scrape metadata from public resources.
- [ ] Discover AWS services and resources in use.

### Security Tools
- **AWS CLI**: For listing resources and services.
- **Recon-ng**: For gathering information and footprinting.
- **Shodan**: For identifying exposed AWS services.

## 2. Access Control Testing

### Checklist
- [ ] Identify overly permissive IAM roles and policies.
- [ ] Check for exposed AWS credentials.
- [ ] Assess AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store for proper protection.
- [ ] Test cross-account role permissions for security issues.

### Security Tools
- **AWS IAM Policy Simulator**: For testing IAM policies.
- **Pacu**: For AWS exploitation and assessment.
- **Credential Scanner**: To detect exposed AWS credentials in code.

## 3. Network Security Testing

### Checklist
- [ ] Review and test VPC security groups for excessive permissions.
- [ ] Scan VPCs and subnets for open ports and unnecessary services.
- [ ] Assess Network ACLs and route tables for security misconfigurations.
- [ ] Evaluate AWS WAF and Shield protections.

### Security Tools
- **Nmap**: For network discovery and port scanning.
- **Masscan**: For fast port scanning.
- **AWS Inspector**: For assessing vulnerabilities in AWS environments.
- **Burp Suite**: For testing WAF configurations.

## 4. Data Security

### Checklist
- [ ] Identify public S3 buckets and assess their permissions.
- [ ] Verify encryption at rest for S3, EBS, and RDS.
- [ ] Check encryption in transit for services and data.
- [ ] Review RDS and database security settings and backups.

### Security Tools
- **S3Scanner**: For finding exposed S3 buckets.
- **AWS KMS**: For managing encryption keys and verifying encryption configurations.
- **sqlmap**: For database vulnerability testing.

## 5. Application Security

### Checklist
- [ ] Test API endpoints for common vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Review Lambda function configurations for excessive permissions.
- [ ] Ensure CloudFront and other CDN services are securely configured.

### Security Tools
- **OWASP ZAP**: For API and web application testing.
- **Burp Suite**: For web application security testing.
- **Lambda Security Scanner**: For identifying security issues in Lambda functions.

## 6. Compliance and Monitoring

### Checklist
- [ ] Ensure CloudTrail logging is enabled and properly configured.
- [ ] Verify CloudWatch alarms and monitoring configurations.
- [ ] Review AWS Config rules for compliance.
- [ ] Check AWS Security Hub for security issues and alerts.

### Security Tools
- **AWS CloudTrail**: For logging and monitoring API activity.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring and alerting.
- **AWS Config**: For compliance assessment and configuration monitoring.
- **AWS Security Hub**: For centralized security management.

## 7. Incident Response

### Checklist
- [ ] Verify the presence and effectiveness of an incident response plan.
- [ ] Test alerting mechanisms for timely responses.
- [ ] Ensure capabilities for forensic analysis and data preservation.

### Security Tools
- **AWS CloudTrail**: For incident investigation and logging.
- **AWS GuardDuty**: For threat detection and monitoring.
- **ELK Stack**: For log analysis and incident response.

## 8. Best Practices

- **Obtain Authorization**: Always get explicit permission before conducting penetration tests.
- **Adhere to AWS Policies**: Follow AWSâ€™s guidelines for penetration testing.
- **Update Regularly**: Keep your knowledge and tools updated with the latest AWS developments and security threats.

## 9. Security Tools

- **AWS CLI**: Command-line interface for AWS services.
- **Recon-ng**: Framework for reconnaissance and footprinting.
- **Shodan**: Search engine for discovering exposed devices.
- **Pacu**: AWS exploitation framework.
- **Credential Scanner**: Tool for detecting exposed credentials.
- **Nmap**: Network scanning tool.
- **Masscan**: Fast port scanning tool.
- **AWS Inspector**: Automated security assessment service.
- **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanner.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source web application security scanner.
- **S3Scanner**: Tool for scanning S3 buckets.
- **AWS KMS**: Key management service for encryption.
- **sqlmap**: SQL injection testing tool.
- **Lambda Security Scanner**: Tool for Lambda security assessment.
- **AWS GuardDuty**: Threat detection service.
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log analysis.
