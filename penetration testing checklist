- [ ] Verify encryption at rest for S3, EBS, and RDS.
- [ ] Check encryption in transit for services and data.
- [ ] Review RDS and database security settings and backups.

**Security Tools:**
- **S3Scanner**: For finding exposed S3 buckets.
- **AWS KMS**: For managing encryption keys and verifying encryption configurations.
- **sqlmap**: For database vulnerability testing.
